# BGRicker

This is my rpeo for www.bgricker.com.

## Getting started

I've put off learning JS for about 9 years, so I'm going to place some basic reminders here:

```bash
npm install
```

create `.env.local` file in the root, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to site's public URL:

```
.env.local

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://bgricker.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
